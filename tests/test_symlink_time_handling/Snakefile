"""Snakemake should work where the input/output of a rule is a symlink, no problem.
   Here we test that updates to symlinks are recognised and that the timestamps
   on symlinks are updated properly.

   Unfortunately this does not work on some Python builds where
   os.supports_follow_symlinks does not include utime().  This includes the Miniconda
   build used on continuum.io.  Therefore this test is an expected failure on those
   systems.

   In practise, the impact of the bug is low - lutime() on a link will just be a no-op
   and users will see a warning message.  Anyone for whom this is a real problem should
   install a fully-working version of Python.
"""

"""Description of the test:

   input_file is a file that is 1 hour old
   input_link is a link to input file that is 4 hours old
   output_link is a symlink to input_link that is 2 hours old

   So output_link needs to be re-evaluated since the contents of input_file changed.

   rule main outputs the time difference between inout and output in hours which
   can be checked by Nose to ensure output_link gets touched by Snakemake but
   neither input_file nor input_link are changed.
