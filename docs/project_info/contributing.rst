==================

Look through the Bitbucket issues for features.
If you want to start working on an issue then please write short message on the issue tracker to prevent duplicate work.


Write Documentation
===================

Snakemake could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official vcfpy docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Snakemake uses `Sphinx <https://sphinx-doc.org>`_ for the user manual (that you are currently reading).
See `project_info-doc_guidelines` on how the documentation reStructuredText is used.


Submit Feedback
===============

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/snakemake/issues

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

Documentation Guidelines

For the documentation, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Put each sentence on its own line, this makes tracking changes through Git SCM easier.
- Provide hyperlink targets, at least for the first two section levels.
  For this, use the format ``<document_part>-<section_name>``, e.g., ``project_info-doc_guidelines``.
- Use the section structure from below.
