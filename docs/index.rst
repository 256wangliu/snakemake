Snakemake is an MIT-licensed workflow management system that aims to reduce the complexity of creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution environment, together with a clean and modern specification language in python style.
Snakemake workflows are essentially Python scripts extended by declarative code to define **rules**.
Rules describe how to create **output files** from **input files**.

-------------
Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    rule targets:
        input:
            "plots/dataset1.pdf",
            "plots/dataset2.pdf"

    rule plot:
        input:
            "raw/{dataset}.csv"
        output:
            "plots/{dataset}.pdf"
        shell:
            "somecommand {input} {output}"


* Similar to GNU Make, you specify targets in terms of a pseudo-rule at the top.
* For each target and intermediate file, you create rules that define how they are created from input files.
* Snakemake determines the rule dependencies by matching file names.
* Input and output files can contain multiple named wildcards.
* Rules can either use shell commands, plain Python code or external Python or R scripts to create output files from input files.
* Snakemake workflows can be executed on workstations and clusters without modification. The job scheduling can be constrained by arbitrary resources like e.g. available CPU cores, memory or GPUs.
* Snakemake can use Amazon S3, Google Storage, Dropbox, FTP and SFTP to access input or output files and further access input files via HTTP and HTTPS.
